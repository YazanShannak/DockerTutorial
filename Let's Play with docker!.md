# Let's Play with docker!

[TOC]



## Intro

this section is mainly intended to give the reader a hand-on experience on Docker Commands. to achieve maximum understanding of Docker technology, we have created a simple tutorial that aims at introducing the reader to the main concepts of Docker technology. So, it is highly recommended to read the tutorial before proceeding with docker commands. You can reach the tutorial from the following [link](addlink).

To start with docker, make sure that docker is already running on your machine after installation. If it is not running , just run it according to your operating system and wait until it prompt you that Docker is running. following that, open `Windows PowerShell` in case you are using `Microsoft Windows` by searching it in `Start Menu`. Alternatively, if you are using  `Linux-based OS`, just Start a new `Terminal window` and let us start playing with docker:

## My First Docker Image (hello-world)

Docker hello-world image is an introductory image that introduces the user to the performed processes by docker to run a container from a certain image, to run Hello-world image type this command in your PowerShell or terminal window :

```
docker run hello-world
```

docker run command start a new container from a certain image. If the image is not available locally  on your machine, docker will automatically download it from docker HUB and start a new container from the image once it has been downloaded. Don't worry about that, we will delve deeper into the details later on. For Now, it is expected to see the following output on your terminal:

<img src="C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\Docker photo\hello-world.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />

Congratulations!! you have just downloaded your first image, created your first container. Good Job.
